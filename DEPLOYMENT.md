## Production Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Firebase configuration is set up correctly
- [ ] Firebase security rules are configured for production
- [ ] All console.log statements are removed or disabled
- [ ] Error tracking is set up (optional)
- [ ] Analytics are configured (optional)

### Firebase Security (Important!)
Update your Firestore security rules for production:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only access their own user document
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Household members can only access their household data
    match /households/{householdId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid in resource.data.members;
      
      // Chores and messages within households
      match /{collection}/{document} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
          request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/households/$(householdId)).data.members;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Firebase Authentication Domains
Add your production domain to Firebase Console:
1. Go to Authentication > Settings > Authorized domains
2. Add your production domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)

## Environment Configuration

### Production Firebase Config
Replace the demo config in `script.js` with your production Firebase configuration:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "your-production-api-key",
    authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "your-production-project-id",
    storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
    appId: "your-production-app-id"
};
```

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Firebase Analytics (Optional)
1. Enable Analytics in Firebase Console
2. Add Analytics ID to your Firebase config
3. Monitor user engagement and app performance

### Error Monitoring
Consider adding error monitoring services:
- **Sentry**: Advanced error tracking
- **LogRocket**: Session replay and monitoring
- **Firebase Crashlytics**: Firebase-native crash reporting

## Performance Optimization

### Caching
Most hosting providers automatically handle caching. For custom setups:
- Set appropriate cache headers for static assets
- Use CDN for global distribution
- Enable compression (gzip/brotli)

### Firestore Optimization
- Use compound indexes for complex queries
- Limit collection sizes with pagination
- Monitor usage in Firebase Console

## Custom Domain Setup

### DNS Configuration
For most providers, set these DNS records:
```
Type: A
Name: @ (or your domain)
Value: [hosting provider's IP]

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: [hosting provider's URL]
```

### SSL Certificate
Most modern hosting providers include free SSL certificates. Ensure HTTPS is enabled for:
- Firebase Authentication requirements
- Better SEO rankings
- User trust and security

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Firebase auth domain error**: Add your domain to Firebase Console authorized domains
2. **CORS errors**: Ensure your hosting supports HTTPS
3. **Blank page on deployment**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. **Firebase permission denied**: Verify security rules allow your operations

### Debug Mode
Enable Firebase debug mode for troubleshooting:
```javascript
// Add this temporarily for debugging
firebase.firestore.setLogLevel('debug');
```

## Scaling Considerations

### Firebase Quotas
Monitor your Firebase usage:
- **Firestore**: Document reads/writes/deletes
- **Authentication**: Monthly active users
- **Hosting**: Bandwidth and storage

### Backup Strategy
- Export Firestore data regularly
- Document your household codes and user mappings
- Consider automated backup solutions

## Post-Deployment

### Testing
- Test authentication flow
- Verify real-time updates work
- Test on different devices and browsers
- Ensure all features work in production

### User Onboarding
- Create user documentation
- Share household codes with initial users
- Set up support channels (email, chat, etc.)

### Monitoring
- Set up Firebase usage alerts
- Monitor error rates and performance
- Collect user feedback for improvements
